# **.NET & Angular Guide: Week 7 - DevOps & Deployment**

## **ðŸ§© Day 34: Finalizing and Deploying the Capstone Project**

Welcome to Day 34! Today, you will bring together everything youâ€™ve learned to deploy your full-stack capstone project. This marks the culmination of your .NET and Angular journey, where youâ€™ll prepare and deploy your application to a live environment.

---

## **ðŸ§© Objectives for Day 34**
1. Review and finalize the capstone project.
2. Prepare the backend and frontend for production deployment.
3. Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud).

---

## **ðŸ§© Step 1: Finalize the Capstone Project**

### **1. Backend Readiness**
- Ensure all APIs are tested and functional.
- Review the Entity Framework Core migrations to confirm database schema integrity.
- Enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) for the Angular frontend.

ðŸ’¡ **Command to Apply Migrations:**
```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

### **2. Frontend Readiness**
- Verify all Angular components and services are working as expected.
- Perform a production build to optimize the frontend.

ðŸ’¡ **Production Build Command:**
```bash
ng build --prod
```

### **3. Cross-Integration Testing**
- Test the integration between the Angular frontend and .NET backend using a staging environment.

---

## **ðŸ§© Step 2: Prepare for Deployment**

### **1. Dockerize the Application**
Create Docker images for both backend and frontend applications.

#### **Backend Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY . .
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o /app

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "YourBackendApp.dll"]
```

#### **Frontend Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:16 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install && npm run build --prod

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist/your-angular-app /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### **2. Push Docker Images**
Push the Docker images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry).

ðŸ’¡ **Commands:**
```bash
docker build -t your-backend-image .
docker build -t your-frontend-image .
docker push your-backend-image
docker push your-frontend-image
```

---

## **ðŸ§© Step 3: Deploy to the Cloud**

### **1. Choose a Cloud Platform**
- **Azure App Service:** Use Azure Web Apps for deploying your backend and frontend.
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk:** Deploy both services as containerized applications.
- **Google Kubernetes Engine:** Orchestrate and deploy using Kubernetes.

### **2. Deploy Backend**
- Set up an App Service or Kubernetes deployment for the .NET backend.

ðŸ’¡ **Azure Deployment Command:**
```bash
az webapp create --name your-backend-app --resource-group your-resource-group --plan your-app-service-plan
```

### **3. Deploy Frontend**
- Host the Angular app on a cloud storage service or integrate it into the backend deployment.

ðŸ’¡ **Azure Static Web App Deployment Command:**
```bash
az staticwebapp create -n your-frontend-app -g your-resource-group -s https://github.com/your-repo -b main
```

## **ðŸ§© Practical Labs**

### **Lab 1: Deploy Full-Stack Application**
**Goal:** Deploy the capstone project to a cloud environment.

ðŸ”§ **Tasks:**
1. Finalize and dockerize both backend and frontend applications.
2. Push the Docker images to a registry.
3. Deploy the applications to the chosen cloud platform.

### **Lab 2: Test the Deployed Application**
**Goal:** Ensure the deployed application functions as intended.

ðŸ”§ **Tasks:**
1. Test all API endpoints using Postman.
2. Verify the frontend connects seamlessly with the backend.
3. Conduct a user acceptance test (UAT).

---

## **ðŸ§© Reflection Questions**
1. What challenges did you encounter during the deployment process?
2. How can you optimize your CI/CD pipeline for future deployments?
3. What additional features could you add to the application to improve user experience?

---

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations on completing Day 34!** Youâ€™ve successfully deployed your capstone project to a live environment. Tomorrow, youâ€™ll focus on refining your CI/CD pipeline and adding monitoring to your application.
