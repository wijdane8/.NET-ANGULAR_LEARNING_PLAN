# **.NET & Angular Guide: Week 3 - Backend API Development**

## **ðŸ§© Day 15: Revision and Exercises**

Welcome to Day 15! Today is a dedicated revision day where youâ€™ll consolidate your knowledge of backend API development in ASP.NET Core. By revisiting key concepts and completing targeted exercises, youâ€™ll reinforce your learning and build confidence in applying what youâ€™ve learned.

## **ðŸ§© Quick Recap of Week 3**

Hereâ€™s a summary of the topics covered in Week 3:

### **Day 11: REST APIs with ASP.NET Core**
- Learned the principles of RESTful APIs.
- Created CRUD endpoints for managing users.
- Tested the API using Postman.

ðŸ’¡ **Key Takeaway:** RESTful APIs are the backbone of web applications, enabling communication between frontend and backend.

### **Day 12: Authentication and Authorization**
- Implemented JWT authentication to secure the API.
- Added role-based authorization to control access to endpoints.
- Tested secure endpoints using Postman.

ðŸ’¡ **Key Takeaway:** Authentication verifies user identity, while authorization determines their permissions.

### **Day 13: Database Integration with Entity Framework Core**
- Connected the API to a database using EF Core.
- Performed CRUD operations on the database.
- Used migrations to create and update the database schema.

ðŸ’¡ **Key Takeaway:** EF Core simplifies database interactions by allowing developers to use C# code instead of SQL queries.

### **Day 14: Advanced API Features**
- Implemented pagination and filtering to manage large datasets.
- Added global error handling for better API reliability.
- Wrote unit tests using xUnit and Moq to ensure code quality.

ðŸ’¡ **Key Takeaway:** Advanced API features and testing improve the robustness and user experience of your application.

## **ðŸ§© Revision Exercises**

### **Exercise 1: Build a Secure User Management API**
**Task:**
1. Create a secure API for managing users.
2. Implement JWT authentication and role-based authorization.
3. Add endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting users.

ðŸ”§ **Hints:**
- Use the `[Authorize]` attribute to secure endpoints.
- Assign roles (Admin, User) during login.

### **Exercise 2: Add Pagination and Filtering**
**Task:**
1. Modify the API to include pagination for the `GetUsers` endpoint.
2. Add a search endpoint to filter users by name or email.

ðŸ”§ **Hints:**
- Use LINQâ€™s `Skip`, `Take`, and `Where` methods.

### **Exercise 3: Write Unit Tests for the API**
**Task:**
1. Write unit tests for the `UsersController`.
2. Mock the `ApplicationDbContext` using Moq.
3. Test the `GetUsers` and `AddUser` endpoints.

ðŸ”§ **Hints:**
- Use xUnit for writing and running tests.
- Use `Assert` methods to validate test outcomes.

## **ðŸ§© Bonus Challenge: Build a Product Management API**
**Task:**
1. Create an API for managing products.
2. Implement secure endpoints for Admin users.
3. Add features for pagination, filtering, and error handling.

ðŸ”§ **Steps:**
1. Define a `Product` model with properties like `Id`, `Name`, and `Price`.
2. Use EF Core to create a database table for products.
3. Secure the API with JWT and role-based authorization.
