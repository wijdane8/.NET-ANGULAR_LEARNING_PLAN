## **ðŸ§© Revision Exercises**
Letâ€™s put your knowledge to the test with these exercises. Try to complete each task without looking at the solutions right away.

### **Exercise 1: Basic C# Console Application**
**Task:**
1. Create a C# console application that takes a userâ€™s name and age as input.
2. Display a personalized greeting message, such as: "Hello, John! You are 25 years old."

ðŸ”§ **Hints:**
- Use `Console.ReadLine()` to take input from the user.
- Use `Console.WriteLine()` to display the message.

### **Exercise 2: OOP in C#**
**Task:**
1. Create a `Person` class with properties `Name` and `Age`.
2. Add a method `Introduce()` that prints a message introducing the person.
3. In your `Main()` method, create an instance of the `Person` class and call the `Introduce()` method.

ðŸ”§ **Hints:**
- Use a constructor to initialize the properties.
- Use string interpolation to format the message.

### **Exercise 3: Setting Up an ASP.NET Core Project**
**Task:**
1. Create a new ASP.NET Core MVC project.
2. Modify the home page to display your name and a custom message.
3. Add a new controller called `AboutController` that returns a simple message.

ðŸ”§ **Hints:**
- Use `ViewData` to pass data from the controller to the view.
- Use `Content()` to return a plain text message from the controller.

### **Exercise 4: CRUD Operations with EF Core**
**Task:**
1. Create a `Product` model with properties `Id`, `Name`, and `Price`.
2. Set up EF Core in your project and create a database.
3. Perform the following CRUD operations:
   - Add a new product to the database.
   - Retrieve and display all products.
   - Update a productâ€™s price.
   - Delete a product from the database.

ðŸ”§ **Hints:**
- Use `DbContext` to interact with the database.
