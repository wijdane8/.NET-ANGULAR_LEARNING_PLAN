# **.NET & Angular Guide: Week 4 - Angular Advanced Features**

## **ðŸ§© Day 20: Revision and Exercises**

Welcome to Day 20! Today is dedicated to revising the concepts and techniques youâ€™ve learned from **Day 16 to Day 19**. Youâ€™ll consolidate your understanding of Angular features and practice your skills through targeted exercises.

## **ðŸ§© Quick Recap of the Week**

### **Day 16: Routing and Navigation**
- Learned to configure Angular routes with `RouterModule`.
- Implemented route parameters and guards to control navigation.
- Created a navigation menu and handled route changes.

ðŸ’¡ **Key Takeaway:** Routing transforms your application into a single-page app (SPA) with dynamic navigation.

---

### **Day 17: HTTP Client and APIs**
- Used `HttpClientModule` to interact with REST APIs.
- Made GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
- Handled API errors using RxJS operators like `catchError`.

ðŸ’¡ **Key Takeaway:** `HttpClient` simplifies API interactions and integrates seamlessly with RxJS for reactive programming.

---

### **Day 18: Data Binding and Event Handling**
- Explored one-way, two-way, and event binding.
- Handled user interactions using event listeners.
- Implemented real-time updates in forms and components.

ðŸ’¡ **Key Takeaway:** Data binding connects your UI and logic, enabling dynamic and interactive experiences.

---

### **Day 19: Services and Dependency Injection**
- Created and used Angular services to manage shared data.
- Leveraged dependency injection (DI) to supply services to components.
- Fetched data from APIs and shared it across components.

ðŸ’¡ **Key Takeaway:** Services and DI promote modularity and code reuse in Angular applications.

## **ðŸ§© Revision Exercises**

### **Exercise 1: Build a Routing-Based SPA**
**Goal:** Create an Angular app with multiple routes and a navigation menu.

ðŸ”§ **Tasks:**
1. Define routes for Home, About, and Contact pages.
2. Add a navigation menu to switch between these routes.
3. Use route parameters to pass data to the Contact page.

---

### **Exercise 2: Implement a CRUD App with HTTP Client**
**Goal:** Build a simple product management app using Angular and an API.

ðŸ”§ **Tasks:**
1. Create a `ProductService` to handle API calls.
2. Fetch a list of products and display them in a component.
3. Add forms to create, update, and delete products.

---

### **Exercise 3: Build a Real-Time Search Bar**
**Goal:** Use two-way binding and event handling to create a dynamic search bar.

ðŸ”§ **Tasks:**
1. Define a list of items in a service.
2. Create a search bar component.
3. Use `[(ngModel)]` and a filtering method to display search results in real time.

---

### **Exercise 4: Share Data Between Components**
**Goal:** Use a shared service to manage and display a to-do list.

ðŸ”§ **Tasks:**
1. Create a `TodoService` to store tasks.
2. Use the service in two components: one for adding tasks and another for displaying them.
3. Add functionality to mark tasks as completed.

---

## **ðŸ§© Reflection Questions**
1. How does routing enhance the user experience in an Angular app?
2. What are the advantages of using `HttpClient` over traditional AJAX calls?
3. Why is dependency injection important for maintaining a scalable Angular application?
4. How does two-way binding improve the efficiency of form handling?
