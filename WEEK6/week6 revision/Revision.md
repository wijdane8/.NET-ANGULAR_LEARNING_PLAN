# **.NET & Angular Guide: Week 6 - Summary and Revision**

## **ðŸ§© Day 30: Summary and Revision of Week 6**

Welcome to Day 30! Today, weâ€™ll review the advanced topics covered in Week 6 and consolidate your knowledge through exercises and reflective questions.

---

## **ðŸ§© Week 6 Recap**

### **Day 26: Advanced RxJS**
- Explored **RxJS Observables** and their role in managing asynchronous data streams in Angular.
- Learned about key operators such as `map`, `filter`, `mergeMap`, and `catchError`.
- Built reactive forms and handled API errors using RxJS.

**Key Takeaway:** RxJS enables powerful reactive programming, making complex asynchronous workflows easier to manage.

---

### **Day 27: Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core**
- Understood the principles of **Dependency Injection (DI)**.
- Implemented DI in a .NET API using `IServiceCollection` and `IServiceProvider`.
- Registered services with **scoped**, **transient**, and **singleton** lifetimes.

**Key Takeaway:** DI promotes modularity and testability in your application.

---

### **Day 28: Middleware and SignalR**
- Explored **custom middleware** for handling requests and responses in ASP.NET Core.
- Implemented real-time communication using **SignalR** for WebSocket-based interactions.
- Built a simple chat application.

**Key Takeaway:** Middleware enables pipeline customization, while SignalR facilitates real-time features.

---

### **Day 29: Lazy Loading and Custom Directives in Angular**
- Implemented **lazy loading** to optimize Angular application performance.
- Created **custom directives** to encapsulate reusable UI behaviors.

**Key Takeaway:** Lazy loading reduces the initial load time, and custom directives enhance the reusability of components.

## **ðŸ§© Practical Revision Exercises**

### **Exercise 1: Build a Real-Time Chat Feature**
**Goal:** Use SignalR to create a real-time chat application.

ðŸ”§ **Tasks:**
1. Set up SignalR in an ASP.NET Core API.
2. Implement a frontend chat interface in Angular.
3. Test real-time message broadcasting.

---

### **Exercise 2: Lazy Load an Admin Module**
**Goal:** Optimize your Angular application with lazy loading.

ðŸ”§ **Tasks:**
1. Create an `AdminModule` in your Angular app.
2. Add routes to lazily load the module.
3. Verify that the module is loaded only when needed.

---

### **Exercise 3: Reactive Error Handling with RxJS**
**Goal:** Use RxJS to handle errors in an Angular service.

ðŸ”§ **Tasks:**
1. Implement an API call in an Angular service.
2. Use `catchError` to handle API errors gracefully.
3. Display user-friendly error messages in the UI.

---

## **ðŸ§© Reflection Questions**
1. How do lazy loading and middleware enhance the performance and scalability of an application?
2. What are some real-world use cases for SignalR?
3. How can RxJS be used to simplify complex asynchronous workflows in Angular?
